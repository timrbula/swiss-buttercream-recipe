          <p>This swiss buttercream recipe is the recipe that put me on the map.</p>
          <p>
            Little did I know 5 years ago when I first shared this recipe that I would be ranking #1 in a google search
            for Swiss Buttercream!
          </p>
          <p>
            Before this most recent change-over to all things Gretchen’s Bakery my recipe was coming up first, even
            before Food Network Recipes and Martha Stewart!
          </p>
          <p>Holy Cannolis!</p>
          <p>
            Originally named the World’s Best Swiss Buttercream, because well…..it has made it’s way around the world
            and back again!
          </p>
          <p>
            So if you are on the fence as to whether or not you should try this recipe…GET DOWN FROM THAT FENCE and TRY
            IT!

                  Over a double boiler, in a large metal bowl whisk together the granulated sugar and the egg whites
                  stirring constantly until the mixture reaches approximately 115 degrees F and the sugar grains have
                  dissolved and are not longer gritty to the touch.
                </li>
                <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
                  Pour this mixture into the metal bowl of the stand mixer with the WHISK attachment and whip on high
                  speed until it is thick, glossy and white in color. The peaks should be as firm as firm can be.
                </li>
                <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
                  In the meantime you can sift your confectioners sugar, and once you have achieved STIFF peaks
                  meringue, add the confectioners sugar all at once with the mixer on very low speed to avoid having a
                  snow shower of sugar all over your kitchen!

                <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
                  Once all of the sugar has been incorporated you can turn the mixer speed to med-high until it is all
                  nicely mixed in.

                <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
                  Be sure your butter and shortening are at room temperature and they are the same consistency. Add it
                  in about 2-3 additions, but FAST Additions.

                  recipe back on the mixer and with the PADDLE attachment on low- medium and let it mix.It will look as
                  if it is broken, and curdled, don't be alarmed this is normal, it will come back together eventually.

                  For those who prefer to use pasteurized egg whites (like Just Whites®) it will take considerably
                  longer to whip the whites and they will not gain the same volume as fresh whites do.

                <br />
                <strong>
                  For those using a hand beater you will not get the same volume as the balloon whisk attachment of a
                  stand mixer, and the whites may take anywhere from 15 minuted to 45 minutes to whip (I have been told)
