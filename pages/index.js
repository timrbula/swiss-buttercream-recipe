          <p>This swiss buttercream recipe is the recipe that put me on the map.</p>
          <p>
            Little did I know 5 years ago when I first shared this recipe that I would be ranking #1 in a google search
            for Swiss Buttercream!
          </p>
          <p>
            Before this most recent change-over to all things Gretchen’s Bakery my recipe was coming up first, even
            before Food Network Recipes and Martha Stewart!
          </p>
          <p>Holy Cannolis!</p>
          <p>
            Originally named the World’s Best Swiss Buttercream, because well…..it has made it’s way around the world
            and back again!
          </p>
          <p>
            So if you are on the fence as to whether or not you should try this recipe…GET DOWN FROM THAT FENCE and TRY
            IT!

                  Over a double boiler, in a large metal bowl whisk together the granulated sugar and the egg whites
                  stirring constantly until the mixture reaches approximately 115 degrees F and the sugar grains have
                  dissolved and are not longer gritty to the touch.

                <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
                  Pour this mixture into the metal bowl of the stand mixer with the WHISK attachment and whip on high
                  speed until it is thick, glossy and white in color. The peaks should be as firm as firm can be.
                </li>
                <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
                  In the meantime you can sift your confectioners sugar, and once you have achieved STIFF peaks
                  meringue, add the confectioners sugar all at once with the mixer on very low speed to avoid having a
                  snow shower of sugar all over your kitchen!
                </li>
                <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
                  Once all of the sugar has been incorporated you can turn the mixer speed to med-high until it is all
                  nicely mixed in.

                <li class="instruction" itemprop="recipeInstructions">
                  Be sure your butter and shortening are at room temperature and they are the same consistency. Add it
                  in about 2-3 additions, but FAST Additions.

                This Recipe Can Be Stored for 4 days room temperature, 2 weeks refrigerator, 2 months freezer

                <u>After refrigeration or freezing:</u>
                <br />
                <br />
                Take it out several hours or a day before you need it, and let it get to room temperature.Place entire
                recipe back on the mixer and with the PADDLE attachment on low- medium and let it mix.It will look as if
                it is broken, and curdled, don't be alarmed this is normal, it will come back together eventually.
                <br />
                <br />
                For those who prefer to use pasteurized egg whites (like Just Whites®) it will take considerably longer
                to whip the whites and they will not gain the same volume as fresh whites do.
                <br />
                <br />
                For those using a hand beater you will not get the same volume as the balloon whisk attachment of a
                stand mixer, and the whites may take anywhere from 15 minuted to 45 minutes to whip (I have been told)

          <h2>MY TWO CENTS</h2>
          <p>
            I make it a rule not to ever change a recipe before I have had a chance to try it, because how will I ever
            know what it was supposed to taste like unless I make it the way the author intended it?{" "}
            <p>
              Now of course I have changed many recipes to suit my liking once I have tested it, BUT ONLY AFTER I HAVE
              TESTED IT. Perhaps it is my way of being respectful to the author, because after all, I do not know
              everything and those who think they do, are missing out on the great many things that others have to
              offer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please be aware that this is a very different recipe than what you may be used to. It is REAL BUTTERcream
              and it’s made with butter, so ummmm it tastes like butter
            </p>
          </p>
          <h2>Trouble shooting:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>"My Whites will not whip</span>!” – Is your bowl very clean and completely free of all traces of
              fat, or grease? Are you using pasteurized (from a carton?) egg whites? Or fresh?&nbsp; Fresh whites always
              whip better, and some have found that pasteurized whites will not even whip at all! Using a hand beater
              will take about two times as long to whip compared to the balloon whisk of a Kitchen Aid or any stand
              mixer.&nbsp; **Also, if using fresh eggs, be sure they are indeed FRESH! (meaning “not old”)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I think many of you are not getting your egg whites STIFF STIFF and glossy before you add the butter and
              shortening. This will cause a thin, runny buttercream that will NOT hold a shape for piping and flowers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Additionally one VERY BIG mistake is to add the butter/shortening to the meringue while it is still too
              warm.&nbsp; This will melt your butter/shortening and you will have butter soup.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              &nbsp;I think some of you are afraid to just DUMP in the confectioners sugar all at once and&nbsp;then do
              the same&nbsp;with the butter/shortening.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              BUT- if you are still having trouble- PLEASE DO NOT PANIC and THROW THIS “so called disaster” in the
              garbage! 9 times out of 10 you can bring it back to life! Simply by continuing whipping until comes back
              together!
              <br />
              HOWEVER for those of you who cannot get your meringue right from the start- well…you can’t make it
              stronger at the end, you get what you get.
